# Hypackel Lite

Welcome to Hypackel Lite! I've received several requests to bring Hypackel back online. Since AWS is expensive, I'm switching to GitHub Pages. However, there's a 3GB limit, so I won't be able to include as many games for now. Game requests are currently closed but will reopen later.

## Deployment

If Hypackel Lite is blocked but .github.io domains are unblocked you can make your own copy:

1. Scroll up and click fork
2. click settings and rename the the repository to `YOURUSERNAME.github.io`. Replace your username with your actual github username
3. click pages and change it to deploy from a branch
4. it should give you a url in a few minutes. if not then go to the actions tab and if workflows are not enabled, click to enable them
